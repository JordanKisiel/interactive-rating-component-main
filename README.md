## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned
Applied and reinforced what I learned from javascript tutorials for the first time. 

### Continued development
While I was able to add some animation to the transition between the rating display and 'thank you' display, I wasn't able to create exactly what I wanted. Therefore, I'd like to learn more about adding animations and how to use them with javascript.

As for HTML/CSS, I'd like to try a more complex design.
